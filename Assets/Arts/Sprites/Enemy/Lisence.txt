PARASITE IN CITY PRE-INSTALLED:
The world and the characters are beautiful. I love the mini games here as they are very fun and add to a positive experience rather than being a nuisance. The character models and animations are beautiful unlike what some other people have to say. And anyone who is saying this game has barely any sexual content is lying. There is definitely more than enough story and sexual content in this game. It takes a lot of hard work and effort to create a game like this and I believe we should at least appreciate it and give it a good review so the developers are able to continue making this game. This game is really nice with atypical graphics, a rich story that holds up. The only drawback is that the female character is only playable and customizable in sandbox. It’s a good game but still lacks content to enrich itself. Just wait and see for the sequel.
